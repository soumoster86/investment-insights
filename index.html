  <h2>Introduction to Investments</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>What is Investment?</strong> Investment is the process of allocating your money into various assets or instruments—such as stocks, mutual funds, fixed deposits, and even cryptocurrencies—with the goal of growing your wealth over time.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Why Should You Invest?</strong> Simply saving money is not enough to secure your financial future. Inflation gradually erodes the purchasing power of your money. By investing wisely, you can beat inflation, achieve your life goals, and build wealth for major milestones such as buying a house, children’s education, or retirement.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Wealth Creation:</strong> Investments help your money grow, turning small savings into substantial wealth over time.</li>
    <li><strong>Financial Security:</strong> Investing helps you prepare for emergencies and future needs.</li>
    <li><strong>Beating Inflation:</strong> Returns from investments typically outpace inflation, preserving your purchasing power.</li>
    <li><strong>Achieving Goals:</strong> Investments enable you to systematically save and grow money for specific goals like home ownership, travel, or children’s education.</li>
    <li><strong>Generating Passive Income:</strong> Some investments provide regular income, such as interest, dividends, or rental yields.</li>
  </ul>
